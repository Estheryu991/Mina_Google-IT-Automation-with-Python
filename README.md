# Week 0:
Introduction to Google Configuration

# Week 1: 
## 1. What We Learnt: 
We learnt a few examples of what Puppet rules look like, including a bunch of different resources and even a conditional expression. We looked over Automating with Configuration Management. In this module, you learnt the concept of automation at scale and how it can be successfully achieved. You’ll learn what it means to work at scale and how automation is needed to scale effectively. Next, you’ll be introduced to configuration management. You’ll learn the differences between unmanaged and managed configuration management. Then, you’ll dive into infrastructure as code and learn about the benefits it brings, like making your fleet of nodes more reliable and repeatable. This is a major benefit when managing systems at scale. In the next lesson, you’ll be introduced to Puppet. You’ll learn how to apply basic configuration management and how Puppet agents and masters interact with each other. Next, you’ll do a rundown of Puppet resources and classes. You’ll learn how resources are basic units for modelling your configurations and how classes are a collection of resources used to achieve a single goal. The final lesson will introduce you to the building blocks of domain-specific language. You’ll learn what Puppet facts are and how it uses a program called facter to analyze, store and gather this information. Your final lesson will cover the driving principles of configuration management. You’ll learn about declarative, procedural, and idempotent principals and how they differ from each other.

## 2. Assessment: 
Were able to Understand the definition of working at scale and how automation is an essential tool, Understood the difference between unmanaged and managed configuration systems
List the benefits of infrastructure as code; Understood what Puppet is and how Puppet facts work

## 3. Assignment: Understand and explain the different types of storage available;
- [ ] Explain the difference between round robin DNS and sticky sessions;
- [ ] List the different types of integration testing that are available;
- [ ] Understand and explain the concept of SLAs;
- [ ] Troubleshoot and debug a system without being physically present;
- [ ] Understand what a rollback is and how they can help in a system failure;
- [ ] Understand how primary and secondary instances can help in a disaster recovery situation;
- [ ] Try to look over the files before the next class.

# Week 2: Deployment Using Puppet
## 1. Learning Contents: 
You need to automatically manage the computers in your company's fleet, including a bunch of different machines with different operating systems. You've decided to use Puppet to automate the configurations on these machines. Part of the setup is already done, but there are more rules that need to be added, and more operating systems to consider.

## 2. Assessment: How was the learning contents? 
Qwiklabs Assessment: Deployment Using Puppet
[ ] Automatically manage the computers in your company's fleet, including a bunch of different machines with different operating systems. You've decided to use Puppet to automate the configurations on these machines. Part of the setup is already done, but there are more rules that need to be added, and more operating systems to consider.
[ ] How to create Puppet classes and rules
[ ] How Puppet interacts with different OSs
[ ] How to use the DSL to create complex rules

# Week 3: Automation in the Cloud 

## 1. Learning Contents:
You’ll learn about cloud services and the different types of cloud services, like SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Next, you’ll learn about scaling in the cloud and how to modify the capacity of your service. You’ll learn about horizontal and vertical scaling, which then ties into automatic versus manual scaling. Next, you’ll explore how much control you have over your system, depending on whether you choose SaaS, Paas, or IaaS, and assess which one is right for your business. You’ll rundown the options available to migrate your business to the cloud using strategies like lift and shift. In the next lesson, you’ll learn how to manage instances in the cloud by creating one! You’ll explore the different options available, like regions, machine types, and lots more. Then, you’ll look into customizing and templating virtual machines to enable you to deploy them at scale. Our final lesson will explore the concept of automating cloud deployments. You’ll learn about load balancers, which ensure that each node receives a balanced number of requests, as well as autoscaling, which shuts nodes on and off, as needed. Next, you’ll learn about orchestration and how orchestration and automation differ. Last up, you’ll learn about infrastructure as code (IaC), or machine readable configuration files that automate configuration management.

## 2. Assessment: How was the class?
We've looked at some ways that we can implement configuration management at your company using Puppet. We saw how we can write Puppet manifests to manage packages, files, and services on one computer, and then extend that to managing more computers by using the server client model. We also checked out how we can use Puppet modules written by other sysadmins or write our own Puppet modules when the existing ones don't meet our needs. We wrapped all this up by looking into how we can test changes to our manifests, and how we can safely roll out changes to our fleet. You've now seen the power of Puppet for managing the configuration of machines in your fleet. You've also seen how a small change can affect a large set of machines, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. There's a ton more things you can do with Puppet that we didn't get to cover. In my team at Google, we're constantly running experiments to test the impact of new features, and see how they might affect the performance of our servers or dependencies.

# Week 4:
## 1. What did we learn:
Building Software for the Cloud, Monitoring and Alerting, Troubleshooting and Debugging. We would explore load balancing further and dive into some load balancing techniques, like round-robin DNS and sticky sessions. 
In this module, you’ll learn all about storing data in the cloud. You’ll rundown the different types of storage available, like block storage and object storage, and how they differ. You’ll explore load balancing further and dive into some load balancing techniques, like round-robin DNS and sticky sessions. Next, you’ll dive into change management, including the different ways to test your changes and how to push them. You’ll explore different testing methods, like unit tests and integration tests. You’ll also cover continuous integration, the use of continuous deployment, and how to apply A/B testing. Next up, you’ll look at some errors you might encounter along the way, like quotas or limits, and how best to avoid or prepare for these. In the next lesson, you’ll get an understanding of monitoring and altering, and review some systems that offer it. You’ll then dive into the concept of SLA’s and how to set achievable ones. Next, you’ll look at basic monitoring in GCP, and create altering policies, set up conditions, and choose aggregators to manage the data. The last lesson will explore troubleshooting and debugging our systems. You’ll learn how to troubleshoot and debug remotely, understand. techniques for how to identify where the failure is coming from, and how to recover from a failure when it strikes.
